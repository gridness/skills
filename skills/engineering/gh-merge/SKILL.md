# GitHub Merge

When work is complete, follow through the remote update procedure.

## Procedure

1. Check git status and diff.
2. Run required tests/checks.
3. Create an appropriate commit message.
4. Commit only relevant files.
5. Push the current branch.
6. Create/update a GitHub PR using `gh pr create`.
7. Enable auto-merge:
   `gh pr merge --auto --squash`
8. Report PR URL and CI status.

## Stacked PRs

If merging to main requires merging multiple PRs, use GitHub Stacked Pull Requests: `gh stack`.

If a PR stack is available or created, use `gh stack merge` to merge it.

## PR Body additions

In addition to pr body always add `closes #<issue-number>` at the end as the new paragraph of the body, if the PR is related to an issue. For example, `closes #99`.

## Notes

- Usage of `gh` cli might be blocked due to sandboxing. Always ask for approval to run `gh` commands.
